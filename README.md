# 👋 Hi, I'm Aleicia Zhu

I'm a Computer Science and Math student at Harvey Mudd College with a focus on backend systems, ML infrastructure, and developer tooling. I build production-grade software that connects research and engineering—often in high-impact domains like healthcare, robotics, and energy.

## 💻 Areas of Focus

- **LLM + API Engineering**: Building and deploying scalable tools for language model evaluation and real-world use
- **Backend & Infrastructure**: REST APIs, containerization, CI/CD, and microservice orchestration on AWS
- **Data Systems**: ETL pipelines, anomaly detection, and database-backed analytics for large-scale applications

## 📌 Featured Projects

- **OpenEMR AI Integration** — Flask APIs and Kubernetes-deployed ML models powering predictions for 70K+ patients across a national health network  
- [**LLM Benchmarking Suite**](https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/medqa-05-11-2025) — Python tooling to compare GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini; revealed 30% domain-specific accuracy gaps and enabled bias audits  
- **Music Symbolic Hashing** — Custom MIDI-audio matching algorithm that raised precision from 47% to 83%  
- **Doctor Finder** — Flask/React app using SQL and graph algorithms to match patients with culturally aligned doctors  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

`Python` `SQL (PostgreSQL)` `Docker` `Kubernetes (AWS EKS)`  
`Flask` `React` `REST APIs` `Git` `PyTorch` `TensorFlow` `ROS` `Linux`  

## 🚧 Ongoing Work

- Building production-grade AI infrastructure and LLM-based tools to automate clinical workflows at [Dasion](https://data-to-decision.com/)
- Developing energy data pipelines and cleaning tools at [Gridcare](https://www.gridcare.io/)
- Improving sensor fusion and navigation reliability for autonomous vehicles (Machine Learning for Autonomy in Diverse Domains Lab)
